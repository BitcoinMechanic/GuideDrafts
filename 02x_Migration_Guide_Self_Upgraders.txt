This guide will cover how to upgrade from EmbassyOS version 0.2.x to version 0.3.0.

If you purchased the upgrade kit from us you can skip to <backing up> unless you received your kit before we completed 0.3.0, in which case please skip to <flashing> as you will need to flash 0.3.0 onto your SD card to continue migrating.

If you have not purchased an upgrade kit from us you'll need the following equipment:

1. A 16GB microSD card - recommended:

2. A 1TB solid state drive is recommended at a minimum if you want to keep a full archive of Bitcoin's history - doing so will improve certain aspects of your Embassy's performance and allow for applications that require it.
2TB is of course better should you want more space. The larger the better, but after 2TB it starts to get much more expensive quickly.
The drive we recommend:
https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-NAND-SATA-Internal/dp/B078211KBB

3. A connector for your drive like this:

Or an enclosure like this:

4. An SD card adaptor like this:

Flashing

Once you have all these you will need to download an 0.3.0 image from <link>. This is free for all existing customers. Anyone who is running 0.2.x who compiled it themselves will need to either compile 0.3.0 themselves or purchase an 0.3.0 image.

Once you have the image, flash it on to the 16GB SD card - the new one, *not* the one currently in your Embassy!

Backing up

It is prudent to back up your Embassy before migrating in the off chance that something doesn't work correctly, or there is an accident of some sort.

If you're unsure how to do this - please follow <this> guide.

With your Embassy safely backed up, it's time to proceed with the migration.

Migration

Begin by going into your Embassy, stopping all running services, and shutting down the device in the Embassy tab.

Once you've heard the power-off sound, wait a few more seconds and then safely unplug the Embassy.

Next, remove the SD card that is in your Embassy and place it into the SD card adaptor, and then connect the adaptor to a USB port on your Embassy.

Then take the new SD card with 0.3.0 on it and place it into the microSD card slot on your Embassy (not into the adaptor - that is for the old SD card!)

Next, plug the SSD into one of the USB 3.0 ports (blue) on your Embassy, then reconnect the Ethernet cable if not already connected.

Now the power cable can be connected and the Embassy powered up.

Power Up

The Embassy will self-install, a process of about 10 minutes. Once complete you should hear <this>

On your computer, open up a browser and go to `embassy.local`

You will be asked to enter a product key.

This can be located on the bottom of your Embassy.

Once entered, select "Recover" then select the microSD card - this will be labelled "rootfs".

On the next page you will be asked to select a storage device - here you should select your SSD.

?If it does not show up, please unplug it, plug it back in again and refresh your browser?

If this drive is not empty, you will see a warning first. If you are happy to proceed, click continue.

You will now need to make a password for your Embassy. This can be changed later on. It needs to be a strong password. This password protects your Embassy. It can be the same one that you used prior to migration, or a different one.

The Embassy will now recover all your data from your old Embassy and once finished, you will hear <this>

Now you will be provided with both a Tor and LAN address with which you can access your Embassy. Please make a note of these.

To use LAN safely, the SSL certificate will need to be added to whatever device you are using to access. This can be downloaded by clicking on `download root CA` and installed by following the instructions <here>

You can now log in to your Embassy via Tor or LAN and given the option of recovering on a service by service basis.

For those recovering Bitwarden - it is now called Vaultwaren.
